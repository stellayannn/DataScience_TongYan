DataScienceProject
==============================

The project objective is to use the appstore_games dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games) to predict the average user ratings of mobile strategy games, and provide references for mobile game developers on the features of popular mobile strategy games.
